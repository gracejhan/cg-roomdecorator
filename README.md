"Virtual Room Decorator"

1. Summary

  Implement a 3D editor that allows users to decorate a room by adding multiple pieces of furniture and change the material of floor and walls. Users can utilize this program to come up with room furnishing ideas when they want to redecorate their room or move in to a new place. This is a program where numerous 3D features learned in the Computer Graphics course comes into one piece. Moreover, it is an application that shows how the things we have learned in class can be applied in a real-life application.
